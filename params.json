{"name":"Inline-less","tagline":"Chrome extension to render LESS that's in <style> tags","body":"# inline-less\r\n\r\n**inline-less** is a Chrome extension designed to help developers who want to use [LESS][lesscss] instead of CSS for some quick styling, but want to avoid the headache of including the library or having to worry about compilation.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Install the Chrome extension by <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inline-less/gphilobijbhnjbeohenlbjccgjhdpodp\" class=\"chrome-addon-install\">downloading and opening the latest CRX build</a>. (If you're having problems on local pages, make sure \"Allow access to file URLs\" is checked in your extensions settings, i.e. `chrome://extensions`.)\r\n\r\n2. Use LESS inline, like so, taking care to set the `type` attribute correctly:\r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n    <title>My cool page</title>\r\n    <style type=\"text/less\">\r\n        h1 {\r\n            &.header { color: red; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // and more...\r\n    </style>\r\n\r\n    <!-- put IDs on your style tags for easy reference later on -->\r\n    <style type=\"text/less\" id=\"named-sheet\">\r\n    \tp {\r\n            font-size: 13px;\r\n\r\n            em {\r\n                font-style: italic;\r\n            }\r\n    \t}\r\n    </style>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <!-- and more... -->\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Watch as your LESS stylesheets are rendered!\r\n\r\n4. When you're ready to ship your code, click the extension icon for copy-and-paste-ready CSS code.\r\n\r\n5. Done!\r\n\r\n## Installing the unpacked extension\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/jimmysawczuk/inline-less.git\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Open `chrome://extensions`.\r\n3. Check the \"Developer Mode\" checkbox.\r\n4.
